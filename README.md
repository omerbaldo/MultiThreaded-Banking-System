# asst4

The structure of this proj:
  one header file to be shared between client and server (makes it easier to share variables/structures like port number between the two)
  client.c
  server.c
  


Still on client side. Got connection to look ok. need to work on writing to a buffer, signaling when threads are created, and writing the input/output funcitons.
